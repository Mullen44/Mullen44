#### Web Development

Just beginning my web development career I have only completed one project.  This projected utilized a Django REST API for the backend that was consumed by a React front end.  The purpose of this project was to develop an web interface to build an advertisement for facebook.  It had to have functionality to add, edit and reload advertisements.
